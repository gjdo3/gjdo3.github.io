This is, I think, the most accessible album that Lightning Bolt has put out. Not to say that this is an "accessible" album by pop standards. 
It's abrasive and harsh, with static-y, obscured vocals and complicated drum rhythms. But it's loud to the point of being painful, and it's 
melodies are not hidden by a harsh wall of distortion. I also think that this album puts more emphasis on Chippendale's drum work than 
usual, even by Lightning  Bolt's standards. Brian Gibson's distorted bass drives the rhythm behind which Chippendale goes nuts with chaotic, 
technical drumming. 
</p>
<p>
"The Metal East"starts out with a quick, pulsing riff from Gibson that goes into a slower, more driving riff while Chippendale brings in 
fast, marching drums broken up with intricate fills and almost jazzy cymbal work.  Chippendale emulates an entire drum corp while also 
playing behind a piano solo. His playing is fast, precise and powerful, with what I would call delicate subtleties. 
</p>
<p>
Half of the tracks follow in the same style as "The Metal East", driving rhythms and chaotic drumming, until grinding to a stop on 
"Mythmaster", a slow, pulsing song that has tribal sounding drums leading into incredible fast breaks along with Chippendale's distorted 
"singing". Then the songs again fall back into standard Lightning Bolt Style, albeit with the vocals being featured more prominently. 
They're treated more as actual vocals than as another layer of noise. You can sometimes even make out what Chippendale is signing about! 
</p>
<p>
The album ends on "Snow White (& The 7 Dwarves Fans)" which starts out sounding like a Electric Wizard song, with a washed out, doomy 
groove from Gibson, leading into more of Chippendale's incredible drums, slowly ramping up into a mess of looped riffs, complex fills and 
barely understandable shttps://github.com/gjdo3/gjdo3.github.io/new/master/post#inging. It's a great way to finish off the album, though I think it is a bit too long at eleven minutes, 
considering the power of Lightning Bolt's playing.  
</p>
<p>
I can't really do justice to the album, so you have to (and should)  experience it for yourself. It kicks ass.
