Boris advocates "noise literacy" as a way to adapt noise to whatever purpose the artist or listener ascribes to it. This being the first of Boris's 
"New Noise Literacy" albums to have found its way online, "Asia" is going to be seen as Boris's first attempt at full on noise music, whether or not
they intended it to be that. 
</p>
<p>
The album opens up with "terracotta warrior", which could have been taken off of "Akuma No Uta" or "Feedbacker", and, as a "traditional" drone metal 
song, is my favorite track on the album. The other two tracks on this album are 100% noise, not harsh noise, but noise, mainly static from what I 
can tell, or, really, static being manipulated in some way. 
</p>
<p>
It's not abrasive or painful to listen to like some noise music is. If you're feeling generous, you could say it's like drone metal if you replaced
the distorted guitars with static. I don't really have any way to go over how good or bad something like this is, it'll be up to the listener to see
if they are enjoying what Boris is putting out. 
</p>
<p>
I'm kind of disappointed by this release, but that's not really fair to Boris. They have been making whatever they feel like for years now, and even if
I hoped this would be more drone and less noise, I don't think that Boris really cares what people want. They make their music, such as it is, for 
themselves.

<p>Favorite track: terracotta warrior</p>
<p>Least Favorite Track: talkative lord vs silence master</p>
<p>tl;dr: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
