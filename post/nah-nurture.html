NAH makes angry music, and it's all the more noticeable for how basic it is. Harsh percussion would be a good way to describe it. 
Punk-hop maybe. And with this release NAH leans more towards the hip-hop side than the punk. Three out of the four tracks on 
"NURTURE" feature NAH shout-rapping over his own drums/noise.

I'm not a big fan of NAH's rapping, but that is because I don't think his music is well suited to having lyrics. I come to him 
to get relevantly unique, drum-focused industrial hip-hop, not to be blown away lyrically. I don't think that his rapping ruins 
any of the tracks on this album, as they are so angry to begin with that the inclusion of lyrics, even if they were positive 
(they're not), the tracks' aggression would stay.

I do really enjoy what NAH does, especially with so little. But his music isn't for everyone. If you don't like loud, angry, noisy 
music, you won't like this. If Death Grips released an album using only Lightning Bolt samples, it would sound like a NAH release. 
And I think that comparison is a testament to the quality of NAH's music. Overall, I enjoyed this album. I'll likely revisit it a 
few times in the future when the mood takes me, but I wasn't blown away either. This is consistent with the rest of NAH's work. If 
you're looking for him to try something new, you won't find it here.
