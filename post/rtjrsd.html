This 12" is like if Run The Jewels collected the songs I disliked the most from RTJ1&2, and topped it off by including an unreleased track which I also don't like. 
"Bust No Moves" sounds boring and bland. It doesn't have the groove or power that the RTJ songs I enjoy, and RTJ's work as a whole, tends to have. It's not a 
banger, it doesn't have interesting production, or interesting lyrics. Killer Mike sounds like he is trying to sarcastically imitate Earl Sweatshirt. "Pew Pew Pew" 
isn't bad, just forgettable. I can't stand "Love Again". I don't enjoy having to mental picture Killer Milk and El-P getting their schlongs tongue-massaged. 
El-P looks like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys and Killer Mike is like 300 pounds and 40 years old, it isn't a pretty imagine. Blockbuster Night Part 2 is okay.

So yeah, I'm not a huge fan of this release, but the actual physical copy is very well put together. My copy doesn't have a traditional cardboard sleeve but rather
a plastic, LP sized envelope, which has the cover art/track listing on a print out inside it. The record itself is transparent vinyl with black and red smudges 
throughout. If an LP could have been beaten up and robbed, this it what it would look like after. I'm not at all impressed by the music on this thing, but it is
really cool looking and it was $16 so I'm not feeling too bad about picking it up. It won't be seeing too much of my record player though.
