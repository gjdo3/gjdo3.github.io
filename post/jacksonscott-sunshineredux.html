I didn't know at first whether to describe this album as laughably bad or genuinely good. It sounds like the love child 
of later Beatles and early Animal Collective. I actually laughed out loud when the vocals started on "Woodworkk",
I thought I had downloaded the wrong album or someone had messed with it. But no, Jackson Scott is serious. His 
singing sounds like it could have come "Loveless". How well this works with psych-revival instrumentation 
ranges from "badly" to "extremely badly". 
</p>
<p>
It's bearable on some tracks, and ruins others. "Ripe for Love" is one of the worst sounding songs I have heard 
all year that hasn't come from a bandcamp/soundcloud artist. It is incredibly, horribly, laughably bad. It's so 
bad, I really have to wonder who thought it sounded good enough to include on an album. "Steal Me" follows in 
this trend, but it's short so you don't have to endure how horrible it is for long, if you manage not to skip it. 
</p>
<p>
Thinking about it again, basically every single track on this album is terrible, a massive failure at whatever it 
is Jackson Scott was trying to do, unless he was intentionally making terrible music. 
</p>
<p>
Despite that though, I have to give him credit for at least trying something interesting, even if it ended up 
a horrifying failure. This is the worst album I have had the displeasure of listening to this year so far, but at 
least it tried something different. 
</p>
<p>Favorite track: AHahahahahahaha </p>
<p>Least Favorite Track: All of them </p>
<p>tl;dr: I couldn't find an emoticon that was throwing up while laughing.</p>
