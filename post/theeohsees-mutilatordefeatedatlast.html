My first exposure to Thee Oh Sees was "The Cool Death of Island Raiders", which I barely remember, more of a blur 
of noise than anything meaningful, but it did turn me off from them for the longest time. I only gave this album 
a listen on the recommendation of someone else and boy was it a good recommendation.

"Mutilator Defeated at Last" is a showcase of the best that Pixies-style alt/surf rock has to offer. A run down 
of some of the standout tracks:
</p>
<p>
"Web" opens up the album with a dance-able riff that has what I think to be a Western tinge to it, sort of like 
how Earth's albums have a country feel to them. Anyway, it goes from a simple riff to an energetic, explosive 
grove. The standout part being the drum work. 
</p>
<p>
"Withered Hand" starts off with muted drum rolls, breaking out into hard rock style riffs and distant, muddled,
gravely vocals. Lead guitar plays an almost literally "vocal" role, playing along with the vocal melody and taking 
over for it in the later half. 
</p>
<p>
"Sticky Hulks" is the slowest track on this album, with a melody played on a digital organ taking up most of the 
song. It's cool, but feels out of place with how frantic the rest of the album is. 
</p>
<p>
"Rogue Planet" sounds like it could have been taken from "Little Busters" by the pillows. 
</p>
<p>
I think that "Palace Doctor" is the weakest track on here, mainly because of the whispered, muted vocals. It's 
not enough to ruin the album and it's not even a bad song, but it ends an album that was incredible for its
frantic energy on a low note. Which is what I don't want to end this review on as I think this is an excellent 
album.
