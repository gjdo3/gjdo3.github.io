Last month, Vinyl Me Please did a re-issue of "Friend and Foe", originally released in 2007. 
I was at first put off by the indie rock label this record (and band) get's slapped with. 
I'm not really a fan of indie rock. I mean of course I have listened to ITAOTS and 
"The Glow, Part 2", but as a whole I find the genre too derivative and formulaic to enjoy.

I was pleasantly surprised by this album. From the get go it is more than your average, safe 
indie rock. This isn't an album made up of love songs accompanied by 3-chord progressions. 
There's real imagination and creativity in the arrangement of the songs on here. I would 
even go so far as to say that some of them could be considered kind of noise-y. I don't 
know if baroque rock is a genre, but I think it describes this record fairly well. There's
complexity and variety in the instrumentation. Menomena goes beyond the standard indie 
guitar/bass/drum set up. There's piano, there's sax, there's drones. I big issue I have 
with indie rock is that, despite how personal the subject matter of the songs tends to 
be, the singer tends to sound disinterested. Not so here. Everyone in the band 
contributes vocals in some way, and they're all genuinely emotive and engaging in their 
performances. The percussion isn't just occupied with keeping time. The drum work is 
complex and worth being listened to on its own. Despite how dense the instrumentation is, 
it has a sense of cohesion that I really enjoy. It would be chaotic if there wasn't so
much purpose behind the music.

Like I said I'm not really into indie rock, but I thoroughly enjoyed this album. I've 
found myself going back to it semi-regularly, and I haven't gotten tired of it after 
repeated listens. My biggest issue with this album is the song "Running". The vocals
are understate and rhythmic, normally something I enjoy, but I think the song gets old 
very quickly, which is impressive considering it is not even two minutes long.

But yeah this thing is great and I really suggest giving it a listen if you haven't.
