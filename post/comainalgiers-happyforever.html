Even though I try to find music on Bandcamp, the amount of stuff you have to 
crawl through makes finding artists that interest you difficult. Especially 
when they have "noise" as a tag.

I'm really digging this album. I really like how in your face the opening 
track "For What" is. It gets the album off to a great start with a noisy,
metallic riff that sets the tone for the rest of the album. There's a 
consistent groove running throughout the songs that reminds me of "Slip It In" 
era Black Flag, especially in "Freeland" and "Let's Get Married. 
</p>
<p>
I know I say that basically every rock album I review has "Swans" as an influence 
but the song "Swansea" sounds like someone listened to "Filth" and wanted to 
copy the style, which it does pretty well. 
</p>
<p>
"Leipzig" ends the album very suddenly, and left me wanting a more solid closing 
track. Despite being four minutes long I feel like it ended too suddenly. 
</p>
<p>
In any case this is a rare gem coming out of Bandcamp and I recommend it if you're 
a fan of noise rock or punk rock.
