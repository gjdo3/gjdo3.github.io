I think that the more influential a musician is, the more difficult it is to fairly review their work. When you mold a genre, 
when literally hundreds of musicians use you as an example, what made your music unique can be lost. When everyone is trying 
to be you, you run the risk of seeming generic and bland, because the norm is something that you originally set. 
</p>
<p>
As such, I think it is hard to fairly give this album a fair shake. When you're such a trend setter that J Dilla and Ras G list 
you as one of their influences, the standard you set for yourself, the expectations you create are enormous. And I don't think 
that <em>Petestrumentals 2</em> meets those expectations. 
</p>
<p>
I think that this album would have been excellent twenty years ago. I think it would have been great ten years ago. But now, it's 
just average. Instrumental hip hop has advanced so much so recently, that this feels stale. This isn't special, this isn't interesting, 
and it's not very entertaining.

<p>
This style of music has been done to death. Soundcloud is full of producers making stuff like this. And it's thanks to old masters like 
Pete Rock that this style of music became popular in the first place. But that doesn't change the fact that the music on here is stagnant. 
</p>
<p>
On top of that, every track on here is far, far too long. Most clock in at three minutes, which is way too long for the samey, bland 
samples to stay interesting. This wouldn't be as bad if this was released as a mixtape for people to rap over, but from my 
understanding, this is supposed to be a stand alone work. And it's just not interesting enough to succeed as that.
