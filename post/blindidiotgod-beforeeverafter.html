This album first came to my attention when I saw it tagged as "industrial dub". Now this, I thought, is something I have to check out. 
I'm not a big fan of dub, but the combination interested me so much I had to look in to it out of curiosity. And while I think that 
there are definitely dub and industrial elements on this album, I think calling it "industrial dub" is misleading. There's tracks on here
that could be described as dub, and tracks which could be described as industrial, but I found no industrial dub on this album. Which isn't 
a bad thing as I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Blind Idiot God hasn't released an album in a decade, this album being made up of material the band has put together over that time. I think 
that explains how varied the material on this album is. "High and Mighty" and "Ramshackle" are dub reggae, "Antiquity"  sounds like no wave/
industrial. Hell, there's even a cover of "Earthmover". There's a ton of stuff on this album and most of it is really good. It's crushing 
and brutal and groovy and mellow, and it never feels jarring when the band switches from one style to another.

I think that it's genuinely impressive that this record is as good as it is. It works, but I don't think any other bands should try it.
