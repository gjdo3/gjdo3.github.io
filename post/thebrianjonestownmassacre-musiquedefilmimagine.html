I usually enjoy soundtracks because I find that they tend to do a good job of conveying 
a story through emotional music, or at least the idea of a story. I especially like 
soundtracks to movies I haven't watched because it lets me imagine events to go with 
the music, sort of like how you imagine how a person you read about looks like without 
ever seeing a picture of them. So, it makes sense that I would enjoy soundtracks to 
movies that don't exist.

This recent (it came out today) release by the Brian Jonestown Massacre is supposed to 
be a tribute to the great filmmakers of the 20th century. Now I don't really enjoy 
films as a rule, I don't make an effort to watch movies nor am I interested in it as an 
art beyond the few movies I actually like, so this album's aspect as a tribute is lost 
to me, but I don't think I need to have an appreciation of cinema in order to enjoy 
"Musique de film imaginé".

It would be easy to try to compare this to  "Soundtracks for the Blind", but I feel like 
that would be lazy. I do get some Swans-eque vibes (The Great Annihilator era swans) 
from a few songs, like "Philadelphie Story", but that is about it.

The album starts off with what I think is a synth-based, sort of ambient piece, leading 
up into "Philadelphie Story". La Dispute features what I think is a harpsichord, and in 
any case, it has a very old-time, almost haunted air to it. It reminds me of The Caretaker's 
"Selected Memories from The Haunted Ballroom." "L'Enfer" has what I perceive to be a definite 
Godspeed You! influence, but the Brian Jonestown Massacre has been around so long maybe
they're the ones who influenced Godspeed in the first place. "Elle s'échappe" has a sort of 
funky, jazz fusion vibe to it, with a pretty prominent base line and a horn section. Le
Cadeau goes back to that haunted sound that I mentioned earlier, but it sounds "newer". 
"Le Sacre du Printemps" is a shoegaze piece, with more atmosphere and less fuzz than is the 
standard for the genre. "Le Souvenir" is a spooky bit of music I could see being included in
the haunted house level of an early 2000's platformer. "Les trois cloches", "Bonbon" and
"L'Ennui" are subtle, instrumental pieces built with bells, synths and chimes, that, I think, 
build up to what is my favorite track, "Bonbon Deux", a short song that starts off melancholy
and ends triumph, at least that's the word that came into my head when I first heard it. It
reminds me of "Communist Daughter" from "In The Aeroplane Over The Sea", though it doesn't 
feature any vocals. "La Question" is a very short track, thirty-eight seconds, of which most
is a happy little melody played on what sounds like some sort of woodwind. "Au Sommet" ends 
the album on a somber note, but it doesn't match the grandeur of "Bonbon Deux".
</p>

Overall I really enjoyed this album. It's even more pleasant because I was not looking forward 
to it (I didn't even know it was being released) and only found out on accident from seeing it 
mention online. I think it's a great collection of genuinely emotive music, and I'll definitely be 
listening to it again in the future.
