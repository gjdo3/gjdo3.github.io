It's hard to critique Godspeed at all. They as a group have produced such an excellent body of work that the standards
they are held to are almost unreachable. If anything, they perfected their own style of post-rock to such a level 
that deviating from it brings them flak from critics and fans (See: Yanqui U.X.O), but sticking to their formula 
makes them seem boring (in so much as Godspeed's music can be described as boring) and their music seem safe. 
Their previous release, "Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!" was nothing revolutionary, or new, but it was 
good. The music power and emotion to it. There was obvious passion behind it, even if the "new" material was not as 
ground breaking as it would have been if it had been released a decade earlier. And that is the same feeling I have 
regarding this latest album, "Asunder,Sweet, and Other Distress". At ~40, it is their shortest album, made up of 
two classic-Godspeed style pieces connected by a pair of drones. The first track,"Peasantry,or, Light!, Inside of 
Light!" has a pretty obvious Earth influence. It sounds like "Omens and Portents |:The Driver" from "The Bees Made 
Honey in the Lion's Skull". It starts off the album loudly and quickly, which isn't standard Godspeed style, but
imagine that the ten minute long track has another ten minutes of build up, and it could have been taken off of 
"Allelujah". Not like this is a bad thing. "Peasantry etc" fades into a roughly ten minute long drone,"Lamb's Breath"
, which I interpret as the build up to the following drone piece,"Asunder,Sweet" which itself build up what I think
is Godspeed's single best piece of music, "Piss Crowns Are Trebled". Taken as a whole, the album really works at 
building up tension that gets released with incredible power on "Piss Crowns". It's driving, it's energetic, it's 
frantic and chaotic. It doesn't have the grandiosity that can be found on "Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to
Heaven" or the subtle atmosphere of F♯ A♯ ∞, but it creates an incredible feeling of energy.

Godspeed does not impress on this album, but that isn't because the music is bad. If this was any other artist I 
would even describe it as great. For Godspeed, this is just what they do, and while it's great to have more 
Godspeed, this album didn't leave me with the lasting impression that their earlier work did. Taken on its own it 
is a great album and definitely worth a listen. Actually, there is one bit of instrumentation that has stuck with 
me over at least 20 listens. I don't know if it is Aidan Girt or Timothy Herzog behind it, but towards the final 
five minutes of "Piss Crowns" there is a gradual built up on the drum kit that explodes into a roll that amazes 
me every time I listen to it. Maybe that's the real lesson to take from this, it doesn't matter if this isn't 
brand new material, it is excellent material.

If I had to compare this to another album, it would be "Akuma No Uta" by Boris. Here's why. I think that Akuma No
Uta is an incredibly well done exhibition piece for Boris, it shows off what the band can do in a variety of styles.
It's a snapshot of Boris as artists, and I think this is what "Asunder" is for Godspeed. If someone has the 
patience to appreciate it I think this would make an excellent entry point to Godspeed You! Black Emperor for 
anyone interested in getting into them.
