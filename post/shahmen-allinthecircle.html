I never though that the hip hop druids aka Shahmen would release an actual album. After listening to the "Enter The Circle" EP
released five years ago I've been hoping for a full album, but as time passed I assumed that the duo went on to different 
projects.
</p>
<p>
So this thing actually coming out took me by surprise, I downloaded it as soon as I heard it was out, and after giving it a few 
listens, it's doesn't sound like 5 years of work, but it is more Shahmen so I'm still happy to have it. 
</p>
<p>
Shahmen is composed of rapper MC BLESS and producer SENSE. I've heard MC BLESS's vocal style described as "Tyler, the Creator, 
but good.", and I think that is an apt comparison, if Tyler wrote about stuff other than himself. Going back to what I said 
earlier, this sounds like hip hop made by druids. Most of the lyrics have a "natural" theme to them, BLESS rapping about trees 
and animals and spirits as a way to deal with modern life. 
</p>
<p>
Some tracks from "Enter The Circle" have been included in "All in the Circle", but the weird thing is how different the mixing 
is compared to the new tracks. In the old ones, MC BLESS's vocals are much more prominent, he is louder and clearer. In the new 
tracks his vocals are pushed further back into the mix and sometimes it is hard to make out what he is saying
</p>
<p>
Overall, this is more of the same from Shahmen, which is great if you enjoyed their original EP. If you didn't, you won't care 
for this.
