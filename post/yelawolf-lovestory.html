If Kid Rock and Eminem did collaboration I think it would sound like this album. 
I actually find some of the beats on this thing pretty interesting, if not good. 
I enjoy the country flavor a lot of these tracks have. When I first gave this 
a listen I didn't know that Yelawolf was on Shady Records but I felt a very 
strong Eminem influence. This hunch turned out to be well founded after some 
research. Now to clarify, I haven't been a fan of any of Eminem’s more recent 
albums, actually, I can't say I "liked" an Eminem record since "Encore" came out
and that album has lost its appeal. I say this because, while I do get an Eminem 
vibe out of this album, it's "new" Eminem. More songs feature Yelawolf actually 
singing instead of rapping and, to me, they sound like they are going for pop 
appeal with would-be catchy choruses.

I don't think this album is bad, but I don't think it is good either. I think that this 
record suffered from not being weird enough. If Yelawolf had gone fully into 
making a country/bluegrass-hip-hop fusion, I would have enjoyed this more for 
the sheer novelty of it. As it is, it's passable. I probably won't be going back to 
this thing anytime soon but I don't regret checking it out.
