I'm sort of conflicted about this album. I want to like it, but I can't. No single component fails on 
its own, but taken together, I can't get past how much most of the tracks on here suck. 
</p>
<p>
"I've always been good at true love" was released the other day through Death Grips's own Third Worlds. 
Whether the band and Death Grips have anything to do with each other beyond that is up in the air right 
now. After repeated listen I have noticed what sound like sound samples taken from Death Grips songs on 
here, and the whole album shares the noisy, punkish, almost lo-fi production that was on Death Grips's
"The Powers That B".
</p>
<p>
Going back to what I said earlier, I do want to like this. There's some good ideas and catchy riffs spread 
throughout, but it is too few and far between to make the whole album any good. Some stand outs: 
"Itchy Itchy Itchy" has a Bleach era Nirvana sound to it, which is pretty cool. 
"Bubble Letters" is really fast paced and catchy until it falls apart in the middle. 
The drums on "Sustain" are pretty good. 
The keyboards/organ on "All She Does is Kill Shit" sound great.
</p>
<p>
Despite some good ideas, the majority of this album is a mess, I'd be disappointed if I came in expecting 
anything.
