I was almost turned off by this album from the get go by Ka's laid back, mumbled delivery. I'm not usually a fan of this kind of 
vocal delivery, popular in trap and cloud rap, but I think Ka makes it work here because of the constant pulse beat of rhythm 
behind his rapping.

The production on this album is very stripped back, which I find refreshing. But stripped back doesn't mean spare, it has restraint 
to it. With jazzy beats becoming more common in up and coming hip hop acts (see Kendrick Lamar's "To Pimp a Butterfly" or really
anything by Tyler, the Creator) it is also great to see funk being used as a base for beats. Instead of the standard  jazz drum beat, 
the basis of most of the tracks on this album are funky bass lines and guitar riffs, repeated over and over and over. It's almost 
hypnotic really, and I think it is what saves this album from being boring. Preservation's production is the highlight of this album
for me.

Ka isn't a bad lyricist by any means, but his uh, less than enthusiastic delivery grates on me, and I am sure I would have had a 
much worse opinion of this album if it had gone safe trap or jazz hop beats. There's something about Ka that reminds me of another 
MC and for the life of my I cannot remember who. Maybe that's a sign of how well Ka takes inspiration from other rappers while 
not mimicking their styles. Or maybe that's just my shallow knowledge of hip hop showing. In any case I think this album is worth a 
listen if you're looking for some laid back hip hop but dislike trap or cloud rap. If I had to make a comparison, I'm reminded of 
Danger Mouse and MF DOOM's "Danger Doom".
