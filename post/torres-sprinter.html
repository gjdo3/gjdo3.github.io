I find it easier to go over why I think an album isn't great than to explain why I think 
an album is bad, so I am really happy to have the opportunity to go over why "Sprinter" 
isn't great.
</p>
<p>
There is absolutely nothing original on this album, but being so banal, Torres creates 
an album that doesn't have any major flaws either. This could have been released a 
decade ago and not broken any ground.   
</p>
<p>
One of the big reasons I don't like singer-songwriters as a whole is because of how 
safe their music tends to be. And that's the word that comes to my mind when listening 
to this album. It's safe, bland alt rock. This sounds exactly like the music that was 
popular on the radio when I was in grade school. 
</p>
<p>
For sure, nothing on here is poorly done, but I find the lack of creativity does more 
harm to music than bad composition or poor instrumentation. This feels like a product 
more than art. A well made, polished and professionally crafted product, put a product 
just the same.
