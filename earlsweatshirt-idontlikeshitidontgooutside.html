Now this is an album title after my own heart. I see it and I think to myself, well, I don't like a lot of things, and 
I don't go outside all that much, so this must be for me! 
</p>
<p>
In reality, I am not a fan of Earl Sweatshirt. I can understand his appeal as a lyricist, but I his flat, uninterested, 
and slow flow, combined with the trap-rap production on a lot of his songs make for a perfect storm of "not for me." 
However, I heard that this album was different than Earl's earlier work, and so I gave it a shot. I'm left feeling 
pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't say I "like" this album, but I did like it more than Doris. If doom-rap or funeral-hop 
becomes a genre, this will be its' "Epicus Doomicus Metallicus".
</p>
<p>
I'm still not sold on Earl's flow, but the relentlessly dreary and dark production on this album really compliment his 
droning, deadened delivery. If cloud rap is dream-pop, this is doom-drone, as far as atmosphere goes. The beats are slow 
and heavy, and the whole album sounds fuzzy and blown out.  
</p>
<p>
Like I said earlier I still don't really like Earl Sweatshirt, or this album for that matter, but I am interested in 
where he is going to go from here, and I'll be sure to check out his new release, whenever they come.
