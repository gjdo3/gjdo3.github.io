Meh. I can't effectively put into words how not impressed I am by this album. It's not that it is bad, it's just 
really, really bland. When the stand out part of your album is a feature by another artist, you should 
really consider producing some more interesting material. 
</p>
<p>
And this isn't boring in the way say, bad drone is boring. None of these tracks are super long or repetitive,
they're just very cookie cutter. Nothing on this album is new, and nothing on this album is done masterfully. 
This album is made up of middle of the road, bland and safe glitch hop beats. There's no atmosphere or 
tension like on "Drift". 
</p>
<p>
The stand out track here is "Cold Stares" featuring Chance The Rapper, who brings in an incredibly depressing
verse that finally brings some emotion into the album. Thinking about it now, it's almost like this is an 
album of beats to be rapped over, rather than to be listened as is. There's just not a lot going on here. If 
you're a fan, it's not his best but it's not bad so you'll probably enjoy it. If you aren't a fan, this isn't 
the album to start with if you are interested in Nosaj Thing.

<p>Favorite track: Cold Stares </p>
<p>Least Favorite Track: Erase</p>
<p>tl;dr:  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
