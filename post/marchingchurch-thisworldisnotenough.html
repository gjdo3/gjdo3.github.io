"Masturbatory" is rarely used as a compliment, but I think that is the highest praise I can give "This World Is Not Enough". Throughout this record, excellent songs are ruined 
through excessive improvisation and self-indulgent lyricism, but the band plays with such obvious passion that it comes out sounding alright. More than anything, this record 
has convinced me that Elias B. Rønnenfelt and his band are something to keep an eye on. His work in Iceage didn't  impress me half as much, although Iceage has put out albums 
easily twice as good as this one. 
</p>
<p>
So why, then, did this album make me think Rønnenfelt and company are worth watching? It's the ideas on display on this album, more than their implementation. Beneath the wank 
and self-indulgence there is, I think, genuine genius. I think Marching Church could end up being one of the biggest bands in post-Punk since Swans or Joy Division, though they 
are not there yet. Though I try to keep an eye out for up and coming talent, I don't think I've ever felt his way in regards to any artist (or group of artists) that I have 
listened to. 
</p>
<p>
But, even if the talent and potential is there, there is no guarantee of success. I think Marching Church has a long way to go, and a lot of refining to do before their sound 
goes from potentially great to truly great. It's not fair to rate an album on what it could be, or could have been. A work should be viewed for what it is, and this album is 
post-punk at it's most self-indulgent, with a few great songs to keep you motivated to keep listening.
