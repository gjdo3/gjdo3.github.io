This is the kind of music I could see being played at the Village Vanguard. There's 
a subtlety to the music here that takes some attention to appreciate. Vijay Iyer's 
classic jazz trio put out some impressive work on here for how it manages to stay 
interesting despite how lengthy some of the pieces get. It's improv without being 
masturbatory. There's a cohesiveness to the music, despite it being a collection of 
Iyer's own work and covers, which I think come from how "together" the band is, how 
quickly it adapts to changes in whatever is being improvised.

However, just because it doesn't get boring doesn't mean it stays distinct. My biggest 
complaint about this album is how all the individual tracks seem to bleed into each
other, stylistically. If I'm not paying attention, it becomes hard to tell when one ends
and another begins, and this isn't a live album, as far as I know. I think that in trying 
to make a record with the energy and uniqueness characteristic of breaks in music, the 
whole album ended up sounding same-y.
