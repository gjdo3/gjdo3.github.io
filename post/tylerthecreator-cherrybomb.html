I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this album. I've even found myself going back to it a few times. Deathcamp is almost too catchy, I can't seem to get that "DE-NUH-DA....DEH-DA~" guitar riff out of my head. 
Cherry Bomb transitions form noisy banger to jazzy rap-ballad an back several times, and I think it does it well. "Deathcamp","Buffalo" and "Pilot" are full of distorted, aggressive beats and guitar samples, 
and what I swear are Final Fantasy inspired synths. They sound like they could have been taken from Nobuo Uematsu's workstation while putting together the soundtrack for Final Fantasy Seven, and work pretty 
well with the already noisy production. If the tracks were more gentle you could almost call them lush, but they're not grating enough to be harsh."Run" is the first track on here that I don't like at all, 
mainly because of how trap-ish it sounds. "Find Your Wings" is a surprisingly gentle, jazzy song. I would call it more R&B than hip hop. The title track, "Cherry Bomb" is the most noisy of the lot. Tyler can 
barely be heard over the wall of fuzz, not that this is a bad thing. Though I think that Tyler has definite skill as a rapper, his themes and presentation are so juvenile as to be laughable. He's a twenty four
year old man talking about how he doesn't like to be told he can't wear his hat inside, or how he doesn't like the attention he himself generates through his antics. I don't know if Tyler genuinely thinks what 
he raps about is meaningful, or if it's all part of the appeal, but it is, I believe, his greatest weakness. Though he does throw in some clever wordplay now and then, some of the lines on this thing made me 
actually laugh out loud, and in the "laughing with" not "at" way.

Moving on, I found "Blow My Load" to be the worst track on this album by far, to the point where I just skip it when it comes up. "2Seater" has a great beat on it that goes to waste on a song that is far too 
long. "Smuckers" features a genuinely terrible verse by Kanye West, which really surprised me. I know Kanye gets more respect for his skill in the production aspect of being a hip-hop artist than as an MC, but 
he is better than this. Maybe it's intentionally bad? 
</p>
<p>
In any case, despite not being a long album, I think this record overstays its welcome. If Tyler had ended this album on "Cherry Bomb" or "2Seater" and released it as an EP it would have been a much better work. 
Still, I did really enjoy a few of the songs on here, and I wouldn't say this is a "bad" album, just sort of unpolished.
