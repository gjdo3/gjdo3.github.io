<h3>Hot Opinions</h3>
<p>Everything here is just my uneducated opinion. I'll try to exlpain <i>why</i> I think what I do about the music 
on here, but that is all it is, what I think about it. And remember, just because something is bad doesn't mean 
you can't enjoy it.

<h3>Why doesn't this site have social media integration</h3>
<p>Facebook is evil, Mark Zuckerberg is the Devil, and Gabe Newell is the anti-Christ.Twitter is a bit better but I 
don't use it so I don't include it here.</p>
