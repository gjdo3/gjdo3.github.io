I uh, have been having a lot of trouble trying to articulate what I think about this soundtrack. I haven't watched <em>Pomegranates</em>, 
so I don't know if the music is fitting to the tone of the movie. It sounds eerie, lonely, and sad. It sounds like the soundtrack to a walk 
through an empty town, or an unfamiliar city. It's like walking along the sea when the fog is rolling in, and you look up and down the beach, 
and you are alone. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Pomegranates</em>, the soundtrack, opens up with <em>Garden of Eden</em>, a noisy, static filled track similar to Jaar's earlier work in 
the Darkside duo <em>Golden Arrow</em>. <em>Construction</em> starts off with the sound of rustle papers and heavy things being moved in the 
distance. Maybe flowing water? It's hard to tell. The ambient noises are distorted and mixed back into the trick. Eventually a lonely piano 
starts playing, but that only shows how desolate the "music" sounds, how empty the soundscape Jaar creates is, like a metronome counting 
in a quiet room.
</p>
<p>
Now I'm not gonna go and do a track by track review, I just want to establish how the album opens up. Starting on the third track, <em>Pass The 
Time</em>, I'm getting a UK Garage vibe, and the album starts to resemble more standard electronic music. I say resemble, because it never 
sounds like something you would find on a house or techno label. The music stays distorted, it has an almost industrial quality too it. Along with 
synths, Jaar is using instrumental samples (whether recorded in studio, or taken from pre existing music, I do not know.) to keep things interested. 
You can hear down pitched bells, plucked strings, piano and organ throughout, along with the occasional chopped up vocal sample. 
</p>
<p>
<em>Divorce</em> and <em>Muse</em> stand out by being the most conventional tracks out of the lot, both being incredibly sad piano ballads. 
</p>
<p>
I did really enjoy this release, and at the end I found myself wanting more, despite it being ~80 minutes long. If you're in the mood to brood, I can 
readily recommend this to you
