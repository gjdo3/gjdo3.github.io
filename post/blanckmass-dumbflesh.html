Coming from Sacred Bones, and having never paid much attention to Fuck Buttons or thier solo projects, 
I was expecting something like Pharmakon, so power electronics or industrial. Instead, I got techno, 
beuatiful, driving-your-car-at-night techno.

I get a strong impression that this album is riding on the neo-80 synth revival that's is, or was, 
kind of popular recently. It reminds of Perturbator or Com Truise, but actually good. Now, that's unfair 
to Perturbator, but this album has a feeling of professionalism that is absent from a lot its contemporaries.

I originally skipped the opening track, "Loam", after about a minute. I heard what sounded like a man singing
in reverse along with the sound of a tape rewinding, and I was having none of that. But after listening to it 
again I realized it actually makes a sort of beat with the singing and the rewinding. Going with the neo-80's vibe, 
this track, and only this track, would be at home in a vaporwave album. "Dead Format" is when I actually started 
paying attention to the album on the first listen, and is perfect driving music. "No Lite" follows in this style, 
whereas "Atrophies" has a stronger sci-fi vibe to it. "Cruel Sport" has a definite glitch flavor, and "Double Cross" 
is the most 80's sounding track on this album, like it was ripped from a shoot-out scene of an action movie. "Lung" 
starts out dark and grimy and ends up being very chill. "Detritus" ends the album in a noisy way, with layers of 
synths and static stacked on top of each other.

Overall, pretty good and if you are looking for an album to provide a soundtrack for your late night drives, this is it.
