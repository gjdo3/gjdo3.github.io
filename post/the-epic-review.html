The Epic clocks in at two hours,fifty three minutes,nineteen seconds, but did not bore me at any one point. 
Washington styles himself after the tradition of Coltrane, but what this record reminded me of was the Bill 
Evans Trio. The subtle(but excellent) rhythm section backing every piece is what sold the record for me. I 
don't really have an in-depth or any meaningful knowledge of jazz (or music in general) but I did enjoy 
this record after a few listens. I think the beginning is the weakest point of the album. "Change of the 
Guard" and "Askim" sound like they could have been taken off of Flying Lotus's <i>You're Dead!</i>. 
Isabelle starts of the attention grabber pieces for me, and the album really starts to show off the 
energy and skill of the players. Speaking to the quality of the songwriting and instrumentation, if the 
album was only the first two pieces it would still be enjoyable. Overall I recommend it heartily.
