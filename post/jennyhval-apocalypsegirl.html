This album feels very personal, to the point where I was uncomfortable while listening to it. 
Jenny Hval talks about things that, to me, seem very personal. I felt like she was writing in 
her diary and I was looking over her shoulder. You see a lot of pop music talk about sex and  
relationships, but I have rarely seen it handled on such a personal level.

This isn't your run of the mill singer-songwriter album. This isn't one woman singing away on 
an acoustic guitar or ukulele. The arrangements here are dark, foreboding. I think this album 
would work very well as a dark ambient album if you removed the vocals. Not that the vocals 
make it any less uncomfortable to listen to, for me anyway.

I actually felt like a voyeur while listening to this. I don't know if that was the intention, 
but I don't usually like singer-songwriters, so this album was refreshing for how different it 
is.
