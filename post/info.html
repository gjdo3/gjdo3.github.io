<h3>Hot Opinions</h3>
<p>Everything here is just my uneducated opinion. I'll try to exlpain <i>why</i> I think what I do about the music 
on here, but that is all it is, what I think about it.
</p>
<h3>What music player I use, and why</h3>
<p>
I use <a href="https://www.clementine-player.org/">Clementine</a>. It has smart playlists, support for fetching track 
information, and plugins for last.fm, spotify, etc, if you use those services. It's the best graphical music player 
available on OS X and Linux, in my opinion, and probably the best music player on Windows (tied with foobar2k, but foobar 
isn't free as in freedom, so I don't use it.)

<h3>Why doesn't this site have social media integration</h3>
<p>Facebook is evil, Mark Zuckerberg is the Devil, and Gabe Newell is the anti-Christ.Twitter is a bit better but I 
don't use it so I don't include it here. Follow me on github if you want~</p>
