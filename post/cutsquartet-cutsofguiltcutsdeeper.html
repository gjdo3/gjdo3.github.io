Out of the four men who make up the Cuts Quartet, I'm only familiar with Merzbow and Thurston Moore, which was more than enough for me to be interested in listening to this release after hearing about it online.
The Cuts Quartet is made up of Masami Akita aka Merzbow, the Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson, Hungarian drummer Balázs Pándi, and Thurston Moore or Sonic Youth fame. And together they have created an
eighty minute long noise/free jazz album.
</p>
<p>
Now, I have not traditionally been a fan of noise OR free jazz. The only Merzbow release I have enjoyed are <em>Merzbeat</em> and maybe <em>Aqua Necromancer</em>. Of course I have listened to <em>The Shape of Jazz
To Come</em> and <em>Machine Gun</em>, but beyond that, my knowledge of, and interest in, free jazz and noise is very small. Mainly because of how little obvious rhythm there is in those styles of music. But, I
did enjoy this album, and I enjoyed it almost completely because of Pándi's drumming.
</p>
<p>
Without him providing a rhythmic base to the music, such as it is, I don't think I would have been able to sit through so much noise. Which isn't to say it's all random harsh noise and saxophone blasts. There is
a definite cohesion between the players here. However, just because the players are in sync with each other doesn't mean that there is an easy to follow flow to the music. I've thought of free jazz as being too
cerebral and technical for me to appreciate as a non-musician, which is why, I think, Pándi's work was/is so important here. He's not doing basic time keeping drumming, his playing could easily fit in a tech
death album, but it has that primal groove to it that I can appreciate. I say primal not because it isn't complex, or well thought out, but because it is, for me, easy to follow. Even if I cannot understand the
technicalities of how it integrates with the rest of the instrumentation, I can appreciate it on a basic level.

Earlier this year I went over my thought's on Boris's <em>asia</em>. I think that this album is what that album could have been. It's noise, but there is a progressive element to it, there's experimentation and
change. It's interesting, if sometimes hard to decipher.
</p>
<p>
I think this album sits in a weird place. I don't think this would be a good introduction to free jazz or noise to someone who has no interest in those genres, nor do I think this will blow away someone who is
knowledgeable about this style of music, but it's just the right blend of "accessible" and "experimental" for me to enjoy it. Granted, since you, the reader, are not me, that's not really helpful, but again, I'm
not very knowledgeable about this style of music.
</p>
<p>
It kept me interested throughout the whole eighty minutes, which is pretty impressive in and of itself. Is it great, or even good? I don't know, but I did enjoy the trip.
