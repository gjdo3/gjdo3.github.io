It's rare to find music that is this happy. This isn't the sugary, puppy-dog love kind of happy that you find all the time in pop music, but genuinely happy, optimistic music. 
It's uplifting, that's the word. There's a pervasive feel good vibe to this album that makes it a joy to listen to.

You see Chance the Rapper's name plastered all over the web when talking about this album, but you must keep in mind that this isn't Chance's album. It's a group effort , and 
that makes it all the more impressive for how it manages to keep up the good vibes despite all the people involved.

Calling it hip hop doesn't really do it justice. I'm reminded of 80's/90's R&B/pop artists like Lionel Richie. This is a pop album album without synth or alt rock influences. 
This album really reminds me of the kind of music my dad listens to, pop music that is so bombastic it could be a parody if it wasn't so sincere. But the live instrumentation 
on here stops it from sounding as manufactured. I'm also reminded of early, early "hip hop", like the Lost Poets. It feels more like a group of artists got together to jam
and recorded it than a coordinated effort to make an album. Sure, they would have needed to jam with a full band and a chorus, but that's the vibe I'm getting.

Which isn't to say that there aren't some killer features on this. Chance is in top form, which I was pleasantly surprised by seeing with ho mediocre his feature on Nosaj Thing's
"Fated" was. Busta Rhymes makes everyone else look like a chump with his feature on "Slip Slide". BJ the Chicago Kid's verse on "Wanna Be Cool" actually had my laugh out loud. 
Noname Gypsy has a great verse that reminds me of beat poetry.

I found myself struggling to describe the instrumentation on this, because there hasn't been a release I have listened to that is similar to it. "World" seems like a cop out to me, 
but that's the best way I can put it. It reminds me of the Gaslamp Killer's live sets or Yanni's arrangements. There's a live band playing with a heavy emphasis on trumpet and 
hand percussion that gives the album a Caribbean vibe to it, along with very well done if a bit generic soul drums/guitar.
</p>

To be honest, I was expecting Acid Rap 2.0, but am really happy with what I got. It's not a perfect album, I think some of the songs tend to go a bit too long, but that doesn't 
really matter. I can't not enjoy listening to this, the aura of positivity is too strong.
