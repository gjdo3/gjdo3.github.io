It's spooky, it's unnerving, it's atmospheric and haunting. The band described it as "ambient drone and noise-rock", but 
I think dark ambient is the best way to describe most of this album. If you've played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Oaq4xeYs-I">The Void</a>, this album would be an excellent choice as an alternative soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
Foun/tain opens up the album with a short, almost danceable beat, featuring spacey percussion. It calls to me mind, for me, 
an abandoned factory, full of pipes and rattling, old machinery. 
</p>
<p>
The second track, "Orange and Lake", is an unnerving drone piece, with what sounds like a slide guitar providing screeching, metallic 
chords. The track is full of reverb, and gives the impression of being in a huge, dark and empty room, with something big
and scary getting closer and closer to you. "Double Linda" is a built around a looping sample of a man talking about a what 
he calls an "anomalous form", which gets reverb'd and distorted over the course of 3 and a half minutes. 
</p>
<p>
"L'avalanche (Song for Fuzz)" reminds me of "Public Castration Is A Good Idea" or "Cop". Early Swans, that is, no wave. It's 
slow and plodding and dense, with the most traditional instrumentation you'll find on this album. It is sort of the odd man 
out considering how heavily this album leans towards ambient, but it is still a solid song. 
</p>
<p>
"Lake and Lime" mixes the spacey, metallic percussion of "Foun/tain" and the creeping dread of "Orange and Lake", and is my 
personal favorite out of the five tracks, and finishes the album out in top form.

<p>Favorite track: Lake and Lime</p>
