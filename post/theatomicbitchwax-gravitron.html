I often find myself getting misled when finding new rock music. Usually something will be described as hard hitting 
or heavy and turn out to sound like Led Zeppelin or something. Which is fine, I enjoy hard rock well enough, but 
when I think "heavy" I think SunnO))) or Earth. I often find that stoner metal gets confused with stoner rock, or 
that psych gets labeled as stoner rock, or that sludge metal get's labeled hard rock. Sometimes I have even found 
that something described as blues rock was merely hard rock revival alt rock (Dead Weather, I am looking at you.) 
</p>
<p>
So when I did some research before buying this latest The Atomic Bitchwax LP (I was drawn to the name really), I was 
hesitant because I have been duped before.

<p>
Happily, what I expected, and what I got, are basically the same thing. This is stoner rock the way it has been played 
for years. Riff focused, distorted blues influenced hard rock. It is almost forgettable in how standard it is, not to say 
it is bad it's just not very innovative.

If you like Zep, if you like Black Sabbath, if you like rush, you'll like this.
