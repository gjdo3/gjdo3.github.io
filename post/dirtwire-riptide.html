I first listened to Dirtwire after they released their self titled album, and 
I was playing a lot of Elite: Dangerous and since then their music has always 
reminded me of space. 
</p>
<p>
I'm a big fan of folk instruments being used in modern styles of music, so as 
a whole I enjoy Dirtwire's style of americana meets electronica, even if it 
relies on standard dance music structure. Banjos and guitars give the music 
enough flavor to keep it from being bland.

This album has a more Caribbean flavor than their previous releases. There's a
bigger focus on hand percussion than before. Their last EP, "The Carrier" had 
two tracks on it that had a singer/singers, and I thought they were the two 
worst tracks on it. Unfortunately, Dirtwire has also included two tracks on this 
album with guest singers. I don't have any issue with the singers themselves, 
but I dislike vocals in dance music, I think they take attention away from the 
groove, which is what really matters (to me) in this type of music. Especially 
singing in the standard verse chorus verse style, as Dirtwire did an EP with 
Kongar-ol Ondar, featuring his Tuvan throat singing, which was pretty cool.
</p>
<p>
I think that "Big Change" has the worst. It's a song about climate change, and 
the topic is handled so poorly I thought it was supposed to be a joke. The 
closest thing I can compare it to is Linkin Park's "Shadow of the Day". 
</p>
<p>
Yeah this isn't ground breaking stuff, but it is decent. If you're a fan of 
Dirtwire you will like this. If you're a fan of dance music, you'll probably 
like it too.
