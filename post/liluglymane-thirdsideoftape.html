This is something I wasn't looking forward to, nor was I even aware of it being released. With Lil Ugly Mane being 
a "defunct" project, I don't think anyone was really expecting this to come out. Now, I've been aware of Lil Ugly 
Mane for a while now, even though I wasn't ever impressed with his rapping technique, even if his production was 
interesting. 
</p>
<p>
So this release served as a perfect introduction to Ugly for me, as he barely raps on it, but delivers some really 
cool music. Calling this hip-hop, or even considering it a cohesive album, isn't really doing it justice. Sure, 
some of the tracks on it have hip-hop movements, but there's also noise, ambient, noisy-rock, and whatever else Ugly felt like tossing in. From his bandcamp, this release is made up of music he has made over the past fifteen years that he, for various reasons, did not release until now. 
</p>
<p>
The "album", being a collection of whatever music Ugly felt like making public, doesn't really have a track list, 
but is broken up into three "sides" each with a part A and B, with each meta-track being ~20 minutes long. After 
listening to this for the first time I had a thought that has stuck with me for a while. This is the meme-rap 
equivalent of J Dilla's "Donuts". Now, that sounds a really stupid now that I wrote it out but I'm gonna stick 
with it. I think there's a lot of interesting material on this album/mixtap/compilation, and I'd recommend it to 
anyone looking for something different, and of course it is worth picking up if you are a fan of Lil Ugly Mane. I 
hope he releases more.
